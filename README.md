## Open Government Partnership (OGP)

- What is OGP? "The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance." ([OGP website](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about)).

- The [Open Government Guide](http://www.opengovguide.com/) is a resource for people working to make their governments more transparent, responsive, accountable and effective. It is designed in particular to support the Open Government Partnership (OGP).

- Example OGP National Action Plans with open education commitments: [USA](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/united-states/action-plan), [Slovakia](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/slovakia/action-plan).
